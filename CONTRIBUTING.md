## Contribution guidelines
It is simple. Just make something like sample1 directory in forms.
Refer following points 
1. Browse the element you want to add in **html elements**.  
2. If your element already exists(like forms) then create new directory in that repo with sample1, sample2 ,... 
   else make a new repo with name of the element such as img, header, navbar, footer etc. and create a new directory with sample1 name in it.  
3. Now add your files in it.  
4. Enter your content in following format in the file:  
```html  
<!DOCTYPE html>  
<html>  
	<head>  
		<title> TEST </title>  
		//if using external style sheet then use following:  
		//<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://abc.com/style/sample.css">  
		<style>  
    			//enter your css here   
		</style>  
	</head>  
	<body>  
    		//enter your html snippet here   
	</body>  
</html>  
```  
5. Now add a screenshot of your html page in browser.
